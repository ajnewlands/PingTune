Provides predefined optimization profiles for low latency, general desktop and network server workloads.

Individual parameters are fully tweakable through the graphical interface as well, including:
- Adjusting the built in Windows network packet throttle.
- Changing the balance between foreground and background application responsiveness
- calculate and set the optimum MTU setting for your active internet connection
- Enable or disable sharing windows updates via peer-to-peer networking
- Disable the digital video recording mechanism built into the XBox app
- Tweak numerous low level networking parameters such as Nagle's algorithm ("Nagling"), ACK delays and frequency, NIC interrupt moderation and buffer sizes.
